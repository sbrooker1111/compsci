//Program #6: Making Change:
//
//Consider the software that runs on a self-checkout machine. One task that it must be
//able to perform is to determine how much change to provide when the shopper pays for a
//purchase with cash.  Write a program that begins by reading a number of cents from the user
//as an integer.  Then your program should compute and display the denominations of the coins that
//should be used to give that amount of change to the shopper. The change should be given using as few
//coins as possible. Assume that the machine is loaded with pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, loonies
// and toonies.
