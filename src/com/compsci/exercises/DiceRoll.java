/*
Program #18: Dice Roll Simulation:

Write a program that simulates the rolling of a pair of dice. Your program should generate
two random numbers between 1 and 6, then output two separate meaningful statements which
tell the user what the number rolled for each di was. Your program should return different
results with every run since the numbers are (pseudo) randomly generated.
