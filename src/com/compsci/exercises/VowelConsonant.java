Program #12: Vowel or Consonant?:

In this exercise you will create a program that reads a letter of the alphabet from the user.
If the user enters a, e, i, o, u then your program should display a message indicating that the entered
letter is a vowel. If the user enters y then your program should display a message indicating
that sometimes y is a vowel, and sometimes it is a consonant.  Otherwise your program should display a
