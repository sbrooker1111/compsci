/*
Program #7: Area of a Triangle:

The area of a triangle can be computed by the following formula, where b is the length of
the base of the triangle, and h is its height:

 area = b x h / 2

Write a program that allows the user to enter values for b and h.
 The program should then compute and display the area of a triangle with base length b and height h.
