/*
Program #19: Compute the Hypotenuse:

Write a function that takes the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right triangle
as its parameters. Return the hypotenuse of the triangle, computed using Pythagorean theorem,
as the functionâ€™s result. Include a main program that reads the lengths of the shorter sides
of a right triangle from the user, uses your function to compute the length of the hypotenuse,
and displays the result.
