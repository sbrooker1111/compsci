/*
Program #16: Average:

In this exercise, you will create a program that computes the average of a collection of values
entered by the user. The user will enter 0 as a sentinel (flag) to indicate that no further values
will be provided. Your program should display an appropriate error message if the first value entered
by the user is 0.
Hint: because 0 marks the end of the input it should not be included in the average.
